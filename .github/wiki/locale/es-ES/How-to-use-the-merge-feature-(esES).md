The merge feature can be used to combine multiple presets so you can look for affixes of different presets at the same time.
Another use case is to create a separate preset for sigils. You can then merge the sigil preset each time you create a new one to complete the preset.

As an alternative to merging you can also setup a Hotkey to switch between them.

When merging presets you can choose to keep the existing colors or to select a new color to overwrite the existing ones.
