You can enable the overlay for the trade feature under settings. 

With the trading feature you can keep track of valuable items. For each item you can set the item type and the preferred affixes. When adding affixes for the trade item you can use the checkboxes to mark the affix as a greater affix.

For estimated prices you could check: https://diablo.trade/listings/items
