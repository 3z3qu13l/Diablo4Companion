Diablo4Companion can either use a single build selected on the main screen of the app or up to 3 different builds when you enabled the `Multi Build Mode`.
To enable and configure this feature first open the affix config menu.

After that use the toggle button to enable it and the config button to select your builds.

The configuration screen allows you to select the 3 builds and set the color for each of them. `Multi Build Mode`supports only a single color for each build, individual colors of affixes are ignored.

The ingame overlay will show colored icons for matching affixes and hide the icon when no matching affix is found.
